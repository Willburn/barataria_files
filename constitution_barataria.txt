Barataria constitution

Preamble
We will not surrender our dreams for Barataria as this would be madness and should be avoided.
Life on Barataria should be seen not as it is but as it should be. 
The citizens of Baratari will make it our business to know ourselves what we need, and while this is a
difficult lesson time is on our side. 
In Barataria anyone should be a king by his own fireside, as much as any monarch on his throne. 
It is encouraged to play the role of the fool - try to break things and ask the silliest questions you could posssibly 
imagine.
